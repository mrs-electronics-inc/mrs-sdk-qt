# Contributor Manual

Contributions from others are more than welcome here! This is an open-source project, after all. While we do use this product for commercial purposes, we also want it to be a helpful resource to the open-source community!

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to install the necessary components on your system for development of the SDK.

### Install Qt

Refer to [this page](https://qt.mrs-electronics.dev/guides/installation) on how to do it. You'll need the cross-compiler toolchains for our Buildroot and Yocto operating systems, so it's not just a vanilla Qt installation.

### Set Up Repo

```bash
# Clone repo.
git clone https://github.com/mrs-electronics-inc/mrs-sdk-qt.git
cd mrs-sdk-qt
# Set up submodules.
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
